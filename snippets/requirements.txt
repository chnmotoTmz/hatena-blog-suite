requests>=2.25.0
aiohttp>=3.8.0 # For async link checking

# Content Processing
beautifulsoup4>=4.9.0
# MeCab Python wrapper (mecab-python3). Requires MeCab library and dictionary to be installed system-wide.
# For example, on Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install mecab libmecab-dev mecab-ipadic-utf8
# Then, pip install mecab-python3
# mecab-python3>=1.0.0

# Content Enhancement
Pillow>=8.0.0         # For image processing (PIL fork)
# bingart: For Bing Image Creator. May need specific version or direct install from a repository.
# Check the bingart library's own installation instructions.
# e.g., pip install bingart (if on PyPI and compatible)
# Consider adding a specific version if known, or a git URL if necessary.
bingart>=0.5.5 # Assuming a version, adjust as needed based on actual library state

# NLP / AI
scikit-learn>=0.24.0  # For TF-IDF, cosine similarity
numpy>=1.19.0         # Often a dependency of scikit-learn, langchain, etc.
langchain>=0.1.0      # Core Langchain library
openai>=1.0.0         # For OpenAI embeddings (used by default in vector_store)
chromadb>=0.4.0       # ChromaDB client for vector store
tiktoken>=0.4.0       # Tokenizer for OpenAI models

# Knowledge Graph
networkx>=2.5
matplotlib>=3.3.0     # For graph visualization

# Note on MeCab:
# If you intend to use MeCab for keyword extraction (in content_processing.keyword_extractor),
# you must install MeCab library and an appropriate dictionary (e.g., mecab-ipadic-neologd)
# on your system first. Then, install the Python binding:
# pip install mecab-python3

# Note on bingart:
# The bingart library's availability and installation method can change.
# Please refer to its official source or repository for the most up-to-date
# installation instructions if the pip install command above does not work.
# For example, you might need to install it from a specific git repository:
# pip install git+https://github.com/acheong08/BingImageCreator@master # Example, check actual repo
# Or a specific fork/version if the main one has issues.
# The version specified (>=0.5.5) is an example; verify compatibility.

# For development & testing (optional, can be in a separate requirements-dev.txt)
# pytest
# mypy
# flake8
